# Z Algorithm

Implementation of Gusfield's Z-Algorithm used to perform special pattern matching where if the pattern and substring in text have a hamming distance of 0 or 1, a match is made.

## Demo

Execute:

```
python hd1_patmatch.py text.txt pattern.txt
```

All occurrences are printed in an output text file along with their hamming distances.
