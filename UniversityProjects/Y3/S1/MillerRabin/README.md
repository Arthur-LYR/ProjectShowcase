# Miller Rabin

Implementation of Miller Rabin primality testing as part of another program. 

## Three Primes Problem

Given an integer n, where n > 7 and n is odd, is it true that n is the sum of three odd prime numbers.

Example:

```
9 = 3 + 3 + 3
```

This program tries to figure it out. To run, simply execute:

```
python threeprimes.py N
```

where N is an odd integer > 9.
