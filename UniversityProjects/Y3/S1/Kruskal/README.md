# Kruskal

Implementation of a modification of Kruskal's algorithm that computes both the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and 2nd best MST of a simple graph.

## Usage

Using the example graph.txt, simply execute:

```
python spanning.py graph.txt
```

In graph.txt, the first row specifies no. of vertice and edges, the rows following represent individual edge information given in form of [u] [v] [w].

The result is generated in an output file.
